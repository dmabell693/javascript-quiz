# javascript-quiz
This application will test basic knowledge of the fundamentals of javascript. Upon clicking the "start" button, the quiz and the quiz's 120-second timer will simultaneously begin. When a question is answered, the next question will appear. When a question is answered correctly, 10 seconds will be removed from the timer. The quiz ends when either the last question is answered or when the timer runs out, at which point your score will be recorded and logged into a list of highscores.
